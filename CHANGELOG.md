# Changelog

## [0.3.9] - 2025-07-09
### Investigation
- **Critical Payment User ID Mismatch Issue**:
  - User 391490 executes `/buy` command and `/status` command
  - User 7918860162 receives payment credits and invoice creation
  - Issue persists despite multiple debugging attempts
  - TelegramConflictError suggests multiple bot instances running
  - Local webhook changes didn't resolve the core issue

### Attempted Fixes
- **User ID Parameter Fix**:
  - Modified `create_invoice_message()` to accept explicit `user_id` parameter
  - Updated `handle_buy_callback()` to pass correct `telegram_user_id`
  - Added extensive debug logging to track user ID flow
  - Fixed callback query handling logic
- **Webhook Debugging**:
  - Set up ngrok tunnel for local webhook testing
  - Configured YooKassa webhook to point to local instance
  - Added comprehensive logging for payment flow debugging
- **Code Analysis**:
  - Verified all handlers use `message.from_user.id` correctly
  - Confirmed payment payload includes correct user ID
  - Added debug logging throughout payment pipeline

### Current Status
- ‚ùå Issue persists: Credits still added to wrong user (7918860162)
- ‚ùå Local fixes didn't resolve the fundamental problem
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TelegramConflictError indicates possible bot instance conflicts
- üîç Moving to production environment for comprehensive testing

### Next Steps
- Deploy to production environment for clean testing
- Clear database and test with single bot instance
- Monitor production logs for complete payment flow analysis
- Identify root cause of user ID discrepancy

### Technical Notes
- Logs show `/buy` command from user 391490 but invoice creation for 7918860162
- Missing "Buy callback received" logs suggest callback handled elsewhere
- pay.c0r.ai service has import errors preventing proper startup
- Need production environment testing to isolate the issue
