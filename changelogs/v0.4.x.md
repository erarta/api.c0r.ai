# Changelog v0.4.x

## [0.4.2] - 2025-08-10

### Added
- Product label scan via Perplexity (vision) with personalized recommendations based on user profile (diet, allergies, goal, daily target).
- Rich result rendering in bot for label scan and dish analysis; localized RU/EN sections and smarter tips.
- "I ate this" flow: informative confirmation with KBZhU delta and updated daily total, plus quick navigation buttons.
- CIS payment routing using Telegram language_code (and country when available); YooKassa for CIS, Stripe + Stars for non‚ÄëCIS.

### Changed
- Primary scan focus moved from barcode to full package/label (barcode optional). Updated user-facing prompts accordingly.
- Prices and naming: Basic package 99‚ÇΩ (20 credits), PRO package 349‚ÇΩ (100 credits). UI renamed from ‚Äúplans‚Äù to ‚Äúpackages‚Äù.
- Favorites list UX: per-item messages with concise KBZhU, ‚ÄúAdd to my day‚Äù and ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù actions.
- Improved translations across RU/EN; localized motivation lines and prompts.

### Removed
- OpenFoodFacts provider and related button/handler in the bot.

### Fixed
- Bot DNS resolution inside containers; added explicit DNS in docker‚Äëcompose.
- Callback routing order so specific handlers (ate_this, scan, fix_calories) are not swallowed by generic action handler.
- Timeouts for ML calls; raised API timeout for Perplexity scans and graceful retry UI.
- Daily calories correction flow: correct delta/new total messaging; added RU prompt.

### Migrations
- 2025-08-08: features_favorites_plans_recipes.sql (favorites, corrections, meal plans, saved recipes, indexes).
- 2025-08-10: user_profiles_avatar_fullname.sql (avatar_url, full_name, index).
- 2025-08-05: daily_calories_table.sql (idempotent RLS/policies/triggers).
