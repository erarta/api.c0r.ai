This is an excellent lean plan, so let’s break it down and I’ll stress-test each point like an expert CTO would.

⸻

✅ 1️⃣ Telegram bot

Good. Telegram is a perfect MVP channel:
	•	No app store friction.
	•	Instant updates.
	•	Easy user acquisition via link.
	•	Zero hosting cost for frontend — Telegram carries it.

No issues here.

⸻

✅ 2️⃣ Domain COR.DIET

👍 Pros:
	•	Short, memorable.
	•	.DIET is niche and relevant.
	•	Brandable.

👎 Cons:
	•	Some people might misremember .diet → .com.
	•	But for a modern, single-purpose brand it’s fine.

🔎 Alternative domains:
	•	CORDIET.AI (makes it clear it’s AI)
	•	EAT.AI (but probably very expensive)
	•	MYPLATE.AI (friendly vibe)
	•	CALORIBOT.COM (clear & broad)

But COR.DIET is clean and unique. I’d keep it for now.

⸻

✅ 3️⃣ AWS EC2 micro

Do you need EC2?
	•	If you use Cloudflare Workers or Vercel Edge, you don’t need EC2 for routing.
	•	You only need EC2 if you want:
	•	To run your own inference server with a self-hosted model (YOLO, Detectron, custom PyTorch).
	•	To save cost vs API fees later if your volume grows.

For v1, since you plan to call OpenAI or a 3rd-party food detection API, skip EC2. Use serverless (Cloudflare, Vercel, or AWS Lambda). Less devops hassle.

✅ Verdict: No EC2 needed at first.

⸻

✅ 4️⃣ api.cor.diet on Cloudflare

Good move:
	•	Cloudflare Workers are fast, edge-deployed, low cost.
	•	They handle images well (up to 10 MB).

Your plan:
	1.	Bot uploads photo → Cloudflare Edge API.
	2.	API calls OpenAI or food detection service.
	3.	API formats reply, sends back to bot.

Perfect. Simple, stateless, scalable.

✅ Good design.

⸻

✅ 5️⃣ Monetization day 1

This is the tricky part. You’ll want:
	•	Free tier: X photos / day.
	•	Paid tier: subscription or pay-as-you-go.

For Telegram:
	•	The easiest is to link to a Stripe Checkout page on your site (cor.diet/pay).
	•	Or use Telegram Premium Bot Payments (harder to set up).

Practical flow:
	•	User hits limit → bot says:
“You’ve used 5 free scans today. Upgrade for unlimited at $5/month → [Pay Now]”
	•	After Stripe checkout, you mark their Telegram ID as is_premium = true in DB.

✅ Use Stripe + DB for subscriptions.

⸻

✅ 6️⃣ Scaling issues

Potential bottlenecks:
	1.	Image uploads: Edge functions have size limits. For big photos, consider S3-style storage.
	2.	API calls: OpenAI or 3rd party image ML is expensive per call. Add usage caps.
	3.	Billing fraud: Some people will try to bypass limits. Use JWT or signed URLs.
	4.	Telegram webhook reliability: Don’t lose messages — use retries, logs.

✅ For first 10,000 users, your design is fine. If you grow big, switch inference to your own GPU server.

⸻

✅ 7️⃣ Database?

Yes — minimal:
	•	Store:
	•	Telegram user ID
	•	Photo metadata
	•	Scan counts
	•	Premium status
	•	Supabase is perfect: Postgres + auth + easy admin.
	•	Or Mongo if you prefer schemaless.

✅ For this use case: Supabase = no brainer.

⸻

✅ 8️⃣ When API is ready → Flutter app

Perfect reuse:
	•	Bot → same API → Flutter app.
	•	Same auth DB → user logs in → same usage limit / billing.
	•	This is exactly how you grow an MVP cleanly.

✅ Good plan.

⸻

✅ ✅ ✅ 🔍 Risks

Risk	Mitigation
Poor image recognition	Use good APIs at first, build your dataset
Abuse / DDoS	Rate limit, signed tokens
Payments	Stripe handles fraud, watch chargebacks
Edge function cold start	Cloudflare Workers are very fast, negligible
GDPR if you store photos	Add T&C, delete photos ASAP


⸻

⚡️ Expert verdict

Your approach is solid, minimal, realistic:
	•	✅ Clear single use case.
	•	✅ Good modern stack: Cloudflare Edge, Supabase, Telegram.
	•	✅ Easy scale path: Serverless → GPU server.
	•	✅ No heavy infra.
	•	✅ Fast to launch.
