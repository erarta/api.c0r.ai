Absolutely — here’s a clean CTO-level top-level architecture + feature map + TODO checklist for COR.DIET based on everything we discussed.

This is the kind of one-page plan you can use to align your team, brief a freelancer, or keep yourself on track.

⸻

✅✅✅ 🚀 COR.DIET — Top-Level Architecture

⸻

🎯 1️⃣ USER FLOW

User:
	•	Opens CorDiet_Bot on Telegram
	•	Sends photo of plate
	•	Bot forwards to API → OpenAI Vision → Nutrition parsing
	•	Result returned: calories, protein, fats, carbs
	•	User gets X free scans → then “out of credits” → CTA to pay
	•	User pays via YooKassa (RU) or Stripe (global)
	•	After payment → credits added → continue scanning

Admin (You):
	•	Opens CorDietService_Bot
	•	Checks stats: daily usage, errors, payments
	•	Gets alerts: failed scans, new payments
	•	Can refund, block, or credit users
	•	n8n automates webhooks, daily reports, error monitoring

⸻

🎯 2️⃣ CORE COMPONENTS

Layer	Tech	Purpose
Frontend	Telegram Bot (CorDiet_Bot)	UX for end-user
Backend	Cloudflare Workers	API Edge Function
Compute	OpenAI Vision API	Image recognition (v1)
Storage	Cloudflare R2	Store images (temporary)
Database	Supabase	Users, credits, logs
Payments	Yookassa + Stripe	Monetization
Monitoring & Automation	n8n on AWS EC2 micro	Workflows, daily reports
Admin	CorDietService_Bot	Internal ops console


⸻

🎯 3️⃣ DOMAIN & ROUTING
	•	cor.diet → landing page → explains value, link to bot
	•	api.cor.diet → Cloudflare Worker → receives photo → does analysis → responds JSON
	•	n8n.cor.diet → your private n8n instance on EC2 → secure HTTPS → runs automations

⸻

🎯 4️⃣ DATA FLOW

User → CorDiet_Bot → Cloudflare API → OpenAI Vision → Cloudflare R2 → Supabase → CorDiet_Bot replies

Payments → Yookassa/Stripe → Webhook → n8n → Supabase → Credits updated → Notify Service_Bot


⸻

🎯 5️⃣ FEATURES MAP

✅ MVP V1
	•	Send photo → get KBZHU (Калории, Белки, Жиры, Углеводы)
	•	Limit: 3 free scans per user lifetime
	•	Pay to get credits (10, 100)
	•	Simple landing page with CTA to bot
	•	Privacy policy
	•	Refund policy
	•	Basic /start, /help bot commands

✅ Admin
	•	Service_Bot with:
	•	/stats — daily usage, active users, revenue
	•	/errors — last 10 failed scans
	•	/refund user — mark refund
	•	/ban user — block abuse
	•	/leads — show who hit limit but didn’t pay
	•	/broadcast — mass message
	•	n8n automations:
	•	Payment success → Supabase → Service_Bot alert
	•	Failure → Service_Bot alert
	•	Daily summary → Service_Bot
	•	Backups of Supabase + n8n

✅ Scaling Ready
	•	Cloudflare R2 for images
	•	OpenAI Vision now → switch to self-hosted YOLOv8 later
	•	Flutter app → same API → same Supabase → easy

✅ Privacy
	•	Photos auto-delete
	•	Minimal user data
	•	GDPR-like policy

⸻

✅✅✅ 6️⃣ TODO — Implementation Phases

⸻

🚀 Phase 1 — Foundation
	•	Register cor.diet
	•	Setup Cloudflare DNS
	•	Build static landing page (CTA → Bot)
	•	Create CorDiet_Bot:
	•	/start, /help, accept photo, forward to API
	•	Create Cloudflare Worker:
	•	Accept image
	•	Call OpenAI Vision
	•	Return KBZHU JSON
	•	Connect Supabase:
	•	users table (ID, credits, plan)
	•	logs table (scans)
	•	Integrate Cloudflare R2:
	•	Store photo short-term
	•	Pass URL to model

⸻

🚀 Phase 2 — Monetization
	•	Setup Stripe for ROW
	•	Setup Yookassa for RU
	•	Add payment links in bot
	•	Add webhook to update Supabase
	•	Add “Out of credits” logic

⸻

🚀 Phase 3 — Automation
	•	Deploy n8n on EC2 micro
	•	Secure with HTTPS & auth
	•	Build workflows:
	•	Stripe/Yookassa → Supabase
	•	Errors → Service_Bot
	•	Daily stats → Service_Bot
	•	Create CorDietService_Bot:
	•	Implement core admin commands
	•	Secure to your Telegram ID only

⸻

🚀 Phase 4 — Polish & Scale
	•	Add refund flow
	•	Add privacy policy & contact
	•	Add Slack/Telegram alerts for critical issues
	•	Launch closed beta
	•	Start building Flutter app once API is stable

⸻

✅✅✅ 7️⃣ Future Upgrades
	•	Fine-tune your own food detection model → cut OpenAI costs
	•	Replace OpenAI with local YOLOv8 on GPU EC2
	•	Add “meal history” for premium users
	•	Add health recommendations (connect with calories burned)
	•	Plug into Apple Health, Google Fit
	•	Add social feature → share meals, rank diets

⸻

🟢 TL;DR — This is your “one-slide” master plan

📌 Everything is serverless-first, cheap, robust, easy to maintain for 1–2 people.
📌 Zero vendor lock-in → all parts replaceable.
📌 Scales nicely → no sudden cost spikes if you control credits.
📌 Ready for a future Flutter app without rewriting backend.
