💥 Alright — let’s get very practical and run the math step by step for your target:
📈 Goal: $2,000 MRR

⸻

✅ 1️⃣ First, lock in your unit economics

Key variable:
👉 How much does a user pay on average?

Suppose:
	•	You offer 10 credits for $4.99
	•	Or 100 credits for $19.99

Let’s assume:
	•	Most pay for the bigger pack (100 credits) → $20 average.
	•	Processing fees ≈ 5% (Stripe/Yookassa).
	•	OpenAI cost ≈ $0.005–0.02 per photo (depending on your final prompt & Vision). Let’s take the upper end for safety: $0.02/photo.

So:
	•	User pays $20 for 100 credits → you earn $19 net after fees.
	•	1 photo analysis costs you $0.02 → 100 analyses = $2 cost → so your gross profit per $20 sale is about $17.

⸻

✅ 2️⃣ How much revenue per paying user?

One $20 pack = 100 photos.

Most likely, a normal user won’t blow through 100 photos in a week.
Food plates → usually 2–5 per day max → 60–150 per month.
So:
	•	100 credits could last ~1 month for a single “heavy” user.
	•	Or 2 months for a normal user.

So let’s take ~$20 per paying user per month as your effective ARPU (average revenue per paying user).
Could be lower for light users — but let’s keep it simple.

⸻

✅ 3️⃣ How many paying users for $2k MRR?

\text{Paying Users} = \frac{\$2000}{\$20} = 100

So you need ~100 paying users each spending $20/month.

⸻

✅ 4️⃣ How many total users?

Now, conversion rate:
	•	Typical bot/utility SaaS with a free limit: 1–5% of all users convert to paid.
	•	Your limit is 3 free credits → direct paywall → this is good! So 3–5% is realistic if the value is clear.

So:
\text{Total Users Needed} = \frac{100}{0.03} = 3333
\quad \text{(with 3% conversion)}

So ~3,300 total bot users → 100 paying → $2,000/month.

⸻

✅ 5️⃣ Cost & margin check

Each paying user:
	•	Uses ~100 photos → your cost: $2.
	•	You net ~$17 profit per user.

So:
	•	100 paying users = ~$1,700 gross profit after inference cost.
	•	Infra (Supabase, EC2 micro, R2) = low → say $50–$150/month.
	•	Marketing: depends on you — but core infra won’t kill you.

So you pocket ~85% margin after OpenAI + infra.

⸻

✅ 6️⃣ Summary math

Metric	Value
Goal MRR	$2,000
ARPU	$20
Paying users needed	~100
Total users needed	~3,300
Expected inference cost	~$200
Infra & tooling	~$100
Net profit margin	~85%


⸻

✅✅✅ 📌 Final numbers
	•	If you can get 3,300 people to try your bot, you only need ~100 to convert to paid → $2k MRR.
	•	If your funnel is clear (limited free scans + instant value) → 3–5% conversion is realistic.
	•	Keep churn low: once people see it works → they repeat.

⚡️ Next: Want help building a funnel sheet?

I can make you a Notion or Google Sheet template:
	•	Plays with conversion rate
	•	ARPU scenarios
	•	Costs
	•	Profit margin
	•	CAC (cost to acquire customer)

So you can tweak your growth plan.

If yes → just say “Yes, build the MRR calculator sheet for me!” and I’ll spin it up 🚀
