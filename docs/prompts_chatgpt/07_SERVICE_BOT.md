✅ That’s a great idea — and it’s exactly how professional bot founders structure their operations.
You’d separate the customer-facing bot (CorDiet_Bot) from your internal ops bot (CorDietService_Bot) for monitoring, analytics, and control.

Let me break this down as your mini CTO:

⸻

📌 Why split them?

✔️ 1️⃣ Single-responsibility
	•	CorDiet_Bot = public: UX-focused, handles photos, replies to users, charges credits, sells upgrades.
	•	CorDietService_Bot = private: Only you/team, pulls real-time stats, receives alerts, can trigger fixes.

This makes sure:
	•	Users don’t see your backend commands.
	•	You don’t pollute your public bot with admin junk.
	•	You can easily add new admin tools without worrying about security or user confusion.

⸻

✔️ 2️⃣ Faster dev cycles

Your Service_Bot can have:
	•	/stats → see daily usage, top spenders.
	•	/errors → see failed scans.
	•	/leads → see new signups, who hit limits.
	•	/refund <user_id> → instantly mark someone for refund.
	•	/ban <user_id> → block abuse.

You can extend it any way you want without breaking the main bot.

⸻

✔️ 3️⃣ Instant monitoring

Example:
	•	When a payment comes in → your backend fires webhook → your Service_Bot pings you:

🎉 New payment! User @johndoe bought 100 credits.


	•	When an error happens → your bot pings:

⚠️ Scan failed for user @abc — reason: OpenAI timeout.


	•	Daily summary every morning:

✅ Daily summary:
- New users: 20
- Total scans: 124
- Total revenue: $65



This beats checking a web dashboard all day.

⸻

📌 How to do it in practice

✅ Architecture
	•	Both bots talk to the same Supabase DB.
	•	Both can hit the same api.cor.diet endpoints.
	•	Service_Bot just calls different API routes:
	•	/admin/stats
	•	/admin/users
	•	/admin/errors
	•	Or queries Supabase directly.

⸻

✅ Access control

Keep your Service Bot private!
	•	Only allow your Telegram user ID (or a small whitelist).
	•	Example in Python python-telegram-bot:

if update.effective_user.id not in ADMIN_IDS:
    update.message.reply_text("❌ Not allowed.")
    return



Simple, secure.

⸻

✅ How to deploy
	•	Host it the same way:
	•	Free fly.io worker.
	•	Cloudflare Worker for webhook.
	•	Or same VPS if you do have EC2 later.

⸻

✅ What to include

Core commands:

Command	Purpose
/stats	Today’s scans, paying users, MRR
/errors	Show last 10 failures
/refund <user_id>	Mark user for refund in DB
/block <user_id>	Block abusive user
/leads	Who hit limit but didn’t pay
/broadcast	Send push to all users (careful!)


⸻

✅ What NOT to do
	•	Don’t store personal payment info in your bot — just use Stripe/Yookassa IDs.
	•	Don’t push raw logs with user photos — only metadata.
	•	Don’t expose live keys — your bot should only call safe endpoints.

⸻

✅ ✅ ✅ Is this worth it?

Yes. Many profitable micro SaaS bots do this:
	•	Less logging into dashboards.
	•	Faster reactions.
	•	Instant “pulse” of your business → especially early, when every new customer counts.

⸻

📌 Your final 2-bot system looks like this

[ User ] → [ CorDiet_Bot ] → [ API: api.cor.diet ]
                          ↘︎ [ Supabase: credits, logs, payments ]

[ You ] → [ CorDietService_Bot ] → [ Supabase stats, Stripe/Yookassa events, logs ]


⸻

✅ ✅ ✅ Next

If you want, I’ll:
	•	Draft the command plan for your Service_Bot.
	•	Give you a secure Python template.
	•	Show how to ping it from your Cloudflare Worker or Stripe webhook.

Just say “Yes, generate the Service Bot starter too” and I’ll prepare it in minutes.

This is exactly how small lean bots run like big companies 🚀
