Excellent — this is exactly how a founder should think:
“How do I watch the funnel, measure LTV, see conversion, catch leaks?”
Let’s break down MISSING PIECES you should definitely plan for from Day 1:

⸻

✅✅✅ 1️⃣ User tracking & monitoring

At MVP scale, keep it light but clear.

What you must log:
	•	telegram_user_id
	•	joined_at
	•	total_scans
	•	credits_remaining
	•	last_payment_at
	•	total_paid
	•	utm_source if you run ads later

👉 Where?
	•	Supabase makes this trivial → one users table + one payments table.
	•	Add a logs table for each scan request: user ID, timestamp, cost, model used.

This gives you:
	•	How many daily active users (DAU)
	•	How many paying vs free
	•	Who hits 0 credits (hot for upsell!)

⸻

✅✅✅ 2️⃣ Conversion tracking

Key conversion points:
	1.	Bot installs → 1st scan
	•	“Do people understand how to use it?”
	2.	1st scan → hits free limit
	•	“Did they try enough to see value?”
	3.	Hits free limit → checkout page click
	•	“Do they click pay link?”
	4.	Clicks checkout → payment success
	•	“Do they convert?”

⸻

Practical ways to do this:
	•	Simple events table:

user_id | event_type | timestamp

e.g. SCAN_COMPLETED, LIMIT_HIT, PAYMENT_CLICKED, PAYMENT_SUCCESS.

	•	Add basic funnel:

1000 installs → 800 scans → 200 limit hit → 40 checkout → 20 paid → 2% paid CVR


	•	This tells you where drop-offs happen.

⸻

✅✅✅ 3️⃣ Analytics dashboard

You don’t need Google Analytics bloat for the bot itself.

Use:
	•	Supabase dashboard + simple SQL queries:
	•	COUNT(users WHERE total_paid > 0)
	•	AVG(total_paid)
	•	COUNT(logs WHERE date = today)
	•	Or connect to Metabase or Retool → visualize daily/weekly usage.

⸻

✅✅✅ 4️⃣ Notifications

Add a simple Slack webhook or Telegram group for yourself:
	•	New payment: ping.
	•	Errors: ping.
	•	Spikes in usage: ping.

You’ll catch bugs, leaks, and abuse instantly.

⸻

✅✅✅ 5️⃣ Privacy & compliance

You must add:
	•	A simple Privacy Policy on your domain cor.diet/privacy:
	•	What you store (photos, user IDs)
	•	Retention policy (auto-delete photos in 24–48 hours)
	•	Data rights (GDPR if you have EU users)

Even if basic, it builds trust.

⸻

✅✅✅ 6️⃣ Support

How will a user reach you if:
	•	They got charged but no credits?
	•	The bot didn’t recognize their plate?
	•	They want a refund?

👉 Easy fix:
	•	Add /support in bot → opens chat to your human Telegram or an email.
	•	Or simple web contact form on your landing page.

⸻

✅✅✅ 7️⃣ Refund policy

Keep it fair but clear:
	•	E.g. “If you used less than 3 credits in 24h, you can get a refund.”
	•	Stripe/Yookassa handle refunds cleanly.

⸻

✅✅✅ 8️⃣ Long-term: improve accuracy

Start logging:
	•	User corrections: “It’s not pizza, it’s lasagna.”
	•	Use this to train your own dataset later → switch off GPT-4 Vision → cut costs.

⸻

✅✅✅ 9️⃣ Marketing

What’s your traffic plan?
	•	Telegram channel → easy.
	•	Ads? → track UTM.
	•	Partnerships → track referral codes.

Add ref_code to your bot link → store it.

⸻

✅✅✅ 10️⃣ One thing founders forget: back up your data

Supabase is great, but:
	•	Turn on daily backups.
	•	Keep logs for billing.
	•	Have a plan to restore if needed.

⸻

✅✅✅ 📌 Final missing parts:

✔️ Funnel:
	•	installs → scans → limit hit → checkout click → paid — measure each step.

✔️ Monitoring:
	•	Errors, failed scans, abuse.

✔️ Trust:
	•	Privacy policy, data retention, refund promise.

✔️ Support:
	•	/support command, email or human Telegram handle.

✔️ Refinement:
	•	Collect corrections, feedback.

⸻

✅ Summary: You won’t regret adding these from day 1

It’s what turns a clever bot MVP into a credible micro SaaS that you can scale or pitch to investors later.
