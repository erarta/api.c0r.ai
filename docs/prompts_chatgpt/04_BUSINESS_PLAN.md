Perfect — you’re asking all the right questions. Let’s tackle each one with clear numbers and CTO-level reasoning.

⸻

✅ 1️⃣ Which ChatGPT model is better for coding: 4.1 vs 4o
	•	GPT-4.1 — in the API, is slightly more precise and reliable for longer, structured coding tasks, especially when you want exact syntax or big code blocks.
	•	GPT-4o (Omni) — faster, cheaper, and better at multi-modal (vision) + very good for short coding + conversational + real-time scenarios. For 90% coding tasks it’s great.

👉 Verdict:
	•	For serious backend code generation or production-quality long scripts: 4.1 (if you have it in API).
	•	For fast iteration, Telegram bot replies, light glue code → 4o is enough.

Today, for your MVP, 4o is perfect. If you later fine-tune a custom coding Copilot → you might prefer a more predictable model like GPT-4 Turbo or a fine-tuned version.

✅ 2️⃣ Is there built-in Telegram payments?

Yes — Telegram has official Bot Payments API, but there are big caveats:
	•	It works with payment providers integrated via Telegram (Stripe is not on the list).
	•	For Russia, you’d need a local payment provider that is approved by Telegram (e.g., Yookassa was supported before).
	•	You must pass certification with Telegram to use Bot Payments.
	•	The UX is good (payment happens inside the chat).
	•	But most bot owners prefer linking to an external checkout for simplicity.

👉 Verdict:
	•	For MVP, use external checkout: Stripe/Yookassa → simple pay link → after payment, update Supabase → bot unlocks premium.
	•	Do Bot Payments only if you want fully native flow later.

⸻

✅ 3️⃣ Business model: credits pricing

Let’s break this down step-by-step.

👉 Cost per analysis:
	•	GPT-4 Vision call: ~$0.03–0.05 per photo.
	•	Cloudflare + storage cost per image: negligible at your scale.

👉 What do you want for margin?
A healthy SaaS margin is 70–90% gross.

⸻

💰 Example credit pricing

Pack	Included photos	Cost to you	Suggested price	Profit
10 credits	10 x $0.05 = $0.50	$0.50	$2.99	~83% margin
100 credits	100 x $0.05 = $5	$5	$19.99	~75% margin

✅ Why this works:
	•	Small pack: higher per-scan price → good for casual users.
	•	Big pack: bulk discount → feels “cheaper” → better upfront cash for you.

⸻

📌 Example packages
	•	🎯 Starter — 10 scans → $2.99 → $0.30 per scan.
	•	🎯 Pro — 100 scans → $19.99 → $0.20 per scan.
	•	🎯 Subscription — unlimited or 30/month → $5–$9/month → recurring!

⸻

✅ 4️⃣ Margin + profit at scale

Here’s a quick table for you:

Users	Avg scans/user	Total scans	Your cost (@$0.05)	Revenue (@$0.30/scan)	Gross profit
100	10	1,000	$50	$300	$250 (~83%)
1,000	20	20,000	$1,000	$6,000	$5,000 (~83%)
10,000	30	300,000	$15,000	$90,000	$75,000 (~83%)

✅ So you keep a healthy ~80% margin, assuming you control OpenAI costs and don’t give too many freebies.

⸻

📌 Key point
	•	Profitability is all about controlling usage.
	•	If someone uploads 10 photos every meal → your costs spike.
	•	So you must cap free usage.
	•	Credits = perfect model for this.
	•	User pays → credits → each scan decrements.
	•	Clear value exchange.

⸻

✅ 5️⃣ What you can do next

I recommend:
1️⃣ Define 1 scan = 1 photo = 1 credit — clear, no confusion.
2️⃣ Build your API to decrement credits in Supabase.
3️⃣ Lock the bot: “Out of credits? Buy more → link to Stripe/Yookassa checkout.”
4️⃣ Bundle discounts for bigger packs.
5️⃣ Later: auto top-up (subscription).

⸻

✅✅✅ Summary

✔️	Do
✅	Use GPT-4o for speed & vision for now
✅	Use external checkout (Yookassa RU, Stripe ROW)
✅	Credits model — transparent & profitable
✅	Aim for min. 70–80% gross margin
✅	Keep edge storage on R2, perfect for images

If you want, I can draw a pricing plan, write Supabase credit decrement logic, or draft your landing page copy. Just say “Let’s go” and I’ll package it up! 🚀
