# Enhanced Nutrition System Features Documentation

## üéØ Overview

The Enhanced Nutrition System transforms basic meal planning into a comprehensive AI-powered personalization platform. Users receive meal plans tailored to their eating personality, behavioral patterns, and detailed preferences collected through an adaptive questionnaire.

## üß¨ Core Features

python scripts/run_migrations.py --database-url $DATABASE_URL

# Check migration status
python scripts/run_migrations.py --dry-run --database-url $DATABASE_URL

# Emergency rollback
python scripts/run_migrations.py --rollback "2025-09-25_enhanced_nutrition_system.sql" --database-url $DATABASE_URL
```

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### 1. Database Migration Test:
```bash
# Test migration on staging database
python scripts/run_migrations.py --database-url $STAGING_DATABASE_URL --dry-run
python scripts/run_migrations.py --database-url $STAGING_DATABASE_URL
```

### 2. API Endpoint Tests:
```bash
# Test questionnaire endpoint
curl -X GET "$API_URL/nutrition-onboarding/questionnaire" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Test preference submission
curl -X POST "$API_URL/nutrition-onboarding/responses" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -d '{"responses": [{"question_id": "primary_goal", "value": "weight_loss", "timestamp": "2025-09-25T10:00:00Z"}]}'
```

### 3. Bot Integration Test:

- **Plan adherence improvement:** > 25%
- **Repeat usage rate:** > 60%

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Migration fails:** Check database permissions and rollback using provided script

3. **Questionnaire not appearing:** Verify internal API authentication between bot and public API
4. **Missing preferences:** Check `user_profiles.onboarding_completed` flag in database

### Emergency Procedures:

1. **Disable enhanced features:** Set `USE_ENHANCED_AI=false`
