    ) -> List[BehaviorPrediction]:

        predictions = []

        # Analyze temporal patterns
        day_of_week = target_date.weekday()
        historical_issues = cls._analyze_day_patterns(nutrition_dna, day_of_week)

        # Stress eating prediction
        if nutrition_dna.archetype == EatingPersonality.STRESS_DRIVEN:
            stress_risk = cls._calculate_stress_eating_probability(
                nutrition_dna, target_date, context
            )
            if stress_risk > 0.6:
                predictions.append(BehaviorPrediction(
                    event="stress_eating_risk",
                    probability=stress_risk,
                    time_window="evening",
                    recommended_action="Prepare healthy stress snacks and calming activities"
