Perfect — you’re thinking like a pragmatic founder — launch fast & safe, then tighten later.
Here’s your post-production TODO to make NeuCor.AI stable, compliant, and scale-ready without slowing down MVP launch.

⸻

🚀 ✅ NeuCor.AI — POST-LAUNCH TODO

📌 1️⃣ Monitoring & Error Logging
	•	Add Sentry for:
	•	Cloudflare Worker: capture request/response + stacktrace.
	•	Telegram bots: capture unhandled exceptions, webhook errors.
	•	n8n: pipe n8n job failures to Sentry (or at least Service Bot).
	•	Test Sentry DSN is hidden via .env — never hardcode.

⸻

📌 2️⃣ Abuse Protection
	•	Add Cloudflare Workers KV:
	•	Create daily_scan_count:user_id keys.
	•	On each /analyze call: increment counter, compare to daily cap.
	•	Return 429 Too Many Requests if limit exceeded.
	•	Auto-reset counters at midnight (UTC) via TTL or daily cron job.
	•	Add blocking logic: if user hits abuse threshold → flag → auto notify Service Bot.

⸻

📌 3️⃣ Image Safety Hardening
	•	Implement EXIF & MIME type check in Worker:
	•	Reject non-image MIME.
	•	Reject images > 5 MB.
    •	Reject Multiple images at once.
	•	Strip EXIF metadata on save to R2.
	•	Add HuggingFace NSFW classifier:
	•	Small Node or Python service → run on the same EC2 or serverless.
	•	On photo upload, call classifier → reject if flagged NSFW.
	•	Optional: log flagged images for manual review (with user ID).

⸻

📌 4️⃣ Product Analytics
	•	Setup PostHog:
	•	Self-host or Cloud version.
	•	Track key events: /start command, photo uploads, payments, conversion funnel.
	•	Link PostHog dashboard → daily digest to Service Bot.

⸻

📌 5️⃣ User Communication
	•	Add auto email or Telegram broadcast for:
	•	Credits low → upsell link.
	•	Payment failed → retry link.
	•	New feature updates.

⸻

📌 6️⃣ Legal
	•	Draft & publish:
	•	Full Terms of Service.
	•	GDPR Data Deletion policy.
	•	Cookie notice (if you go web).
	•	Add auto-delete function: user can request account + photo logs removal.

⸻

📌 7️⃣ Cost & Scale Control
	•	Setup alerts for:
	•	Cloudflare Worker usage spikes (DDoS?).
	•	OpenAI spend limit (set hard budget).
	•	Supabase storage near quota.
	•	Evaluate pre-billing vs post-pay:
	•	Do you need bigger payment packs? Subscription?

⸻

📌 8️⃣ Backup & Recovery
	•	Verify Supabase daily backups → test restore once.
	•	Keep image retention minimal → auto-delete R2 photos older than X days.
	•	Store important logs (payments, user actions) redundantly — daily export to S3 or Drive.

⸻

✅ Final Golden Rule: Keep Post-Launch Clean
	•	Keep your Service Bot your single source for:
	•	Daily stats
	•	Errors
	•	Abusers
	•	Payments

⸻

🟢 Bonus: Suggested Timeline
	•	Week 1 Post-Launch: Add Sentry, EXIF/MIME checks.
	•	Week 2: Hook in PostHog + daily usage limits (KV).
	•	Week 3: Add NSFW classifier.
	•	Week 4: Full legal docs + auto deletion flow.

Want me to:
👉 Draft example EXIF/MIME checker snippet for Worker?
👉 Generate HuggingFace NSFW wrapper?
👉 Write Sentry boilerplate for your Python bot?
I can drop all 3 so you plug & test when ready — say “Yes, pack it!” 🚀
