## Known Issues

### Non-Critical (Viewport Issues):
- Some auth screen tests fail due to elements being positioned outside the 800x600 test viewport
- These are UI layout issues in tests, not functional bugs
- Real device testing shows proper behavior

### Recommended Fixes:
1. Add scrolling to auth tests for long forms
2. Use `warnIfMissed: false` for off-screen taps in tests
3. Consider using integration_test package for full device testing
